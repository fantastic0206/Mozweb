$lang['politicas_de_backup_content_1'] = '<h3>Backup Policies for Shared Hosting Plans and Reseller Hosting:</h3><br><p> Any and all backup copies, or backups, are essential for any service that involves data storage. With this, we want to emphasize that it is the exclusive responsibility of the customer, to keep updated copies of their websites, databases, images, and any other resources hosted on MOZWEB servers. Our company provides resources to facilitate the backup process, which, in turn, can be performed via FTP or through your own cPanel or Plesk panel. This service is available free of charge to ALL our Shared Web Hosting and Reseller Hosting customers. If you dont know how to do this, we provide a step-by-step tutorial <a href=""> available here,</a>explaining how to proceed, to generate a complete backup of your site.</p>
<br> <p> The backup creation service for the client is free and available at any time. To do this, just follow the tutorial mentioned above to know how to make your backup. </p>
<br> <p> MOZWEB carries out daily incremental backups on all of its servers shared by 12:00 am, making it impossible to recover files prior to this period. However, MOZWEB is not responsible for lost data, time, refunds or any other resource due to defective or non-existent backups. Our backup churn is<b>daily</b>.</p>
<br><p><b>Only accounts with up to 20GB of storage in use will be in our backup routine. If the account exceeds the mentioned limit, it will automatically exit our backup routine. Therefore, MOZWEB will have no conditions or obligations to store or restore data from these accounts, unless the customer provides its own backup to restore data such as cWatch Backup.</b></p>
<br> <p> If your account is suspended for any reason that violates our terms of use or for default, we are not responsible for generating or storing copies of your files on our servers. The backup must be performed EXCLUSIVELY by the customer through cPanel or Plesk, as long as he has access to it.</p>
<br><p>If your account has been terminated deleted due to non-payment or any other reason, MOZWEB will store the data from the last successful Backup performed for 40 days, within those 40 days if the customer wishes to restore the MOZWEB will charge an additional fee corresponding to 2x The cost of the hosting plan you were using. after 40 days the data stored on our backup servers will be deleted and can no longer be restored. </p>
<br><p>Please, whenever possible, back up your data for your own security. If it is necessary to restore any backup from our servers, just contact us through the Client Area. Files are copied to our servers on a separate or remote hard drive. We cannot guarantee 100% recovery of your files, but we will do our best to recover everything we can.</p>
<hr class = "sidebar_line"><h3>Backup Policies on VPS, Cloud and Dedicated Server:</h3><br>
<p>Due to the nature of VPS, Cloud and Dedicated servers, MOZWEB does not provide any type of backup solution by default. This activity is the customers full responsibility. If you have your own backup, and you want our support team to restore this copy, you can request the procedure for a fee.</p>
<br><p>If the customer chooses to allow backups to be made on the local disk or VPS / Dedicated partition, keep in mind that the space that the backups will use will be counted together with the total space used on the disk hard. If the disk fails, gets<i>hacked</i>or corrupted, MOZWEB will not be held responsible for not having backup files from your server.</p>
<hr class = "sidebar_line"><h3>Backup Policies on Streaming Server:</h3><br>
<p>For Audio Streaming plans, MOZWEB informs that it does NOT perform any type of backup or copy process of its files. Therefore, the client is aware and responsible for making copies of his files whenever he deems necessary, through FTP access (while he has access to it), exempting MOZWEB from any data loss, should it occur. </P>
<br><br><p><strong>Remember: your files are the "backbone" your business and we ask that you take the best precautions to ensure their safety.</strong></p><br><br>

<p><strong>Hosting / RESALE ACCOUNT MIGRATION PROCESS:</strong></p>

<p><strong>A)</strong>MOZWEB undertakes to attempt to transfer your account hosted on another server, provided that they are accounts that use the cPanel or Plesk administrative panel and that there are no restrictions on the options for "Full Backup". In this way, a complete transfer of your plan will be carried out and all your account information will be preserved: files, databases, emails, passwords, etc. After your account is migrated, minor adjustments may be necessary, as small configuration details may differ between hosting companies. Our team will do their utmost to successfully transfer your account, but we cannot estimate the time required for each transfer, as several factors influence this activity;</p><br>
<p><strong>B)</strong>the CONTRACTING PARTY must understand that some providers only enable the "full backup" function outside business hours. After opening the ticket in your Customer Area in the "Support" department, MOZWEB will perform a brief analysis on your current server and, if it has this block, we will be scheduling it for a time after 11 pm. </P><br><br>

This test is 100% real and, regardless of whether your site is hosted with us or not, it will show the collected data. Remember, many factors can make your site seem down to you and working normally for the rest of the world. Among them, blocking by providers, DNS, Cache, settings on your computer and many other factors. Keep in mind that there is no middle ground, or it is in the air or out for everyone. Avoiding this rule, contact support for your link and / or equipment if this test shows that everything is working correctly with the domain in question.</p>';
